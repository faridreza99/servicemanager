Title: IT Service Platform — Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn + Prisma + WebSockets + JWT Auth

Build a full IT Service Management System with the following strict requirements:

🔹 STRICT TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS

The project must be built using Next.js (App Router + TypeScript).

Authentication must use pure JWT (JSON Web Token) — do NOT use NextAuth.

UI components must use shadcn/ui.

Styling must use Tailwind CSS.

Database ORM must be Prisma (I will provide DATABASE_URL).

Real-time chat must use WebSockets (Socket.IO).

Fully compatible with Replit runtime.

🔹 USER ROLES

Customer

View services (NO pricing).

After booking → a real-time chat opens.

Chat continues until admin closes it.

Customer can send private messages only to admin.

Must approve every new user before login is allowed.

Create/edit/delete/activate services.

View all bookings.

Join any chat.
